# Python package requirements for the apart‑hotel management application
#
# This file lists the third‑party dependencies required to run the
# Flask web application.  When deploying to a platform like
# Render.com or Vercel, ensure that your build process installs
# these packages via pip, e.g. `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

# Flask is the web framework used for the application.  A fairly
# recent version is recommended.  Werkzeug is installed as a
# dependency of Flask but is listed explicitly here for clarity.
Flask>=2.2
Werkzeug>=2.2

# psycopg2-binary provides the PostgreSQL driver used when
# DATABASE_URL is set.  If you are not using PostgreSQL you may
# omit this dependency, but it is required for Render deployments
# targeting a Postgres database.
psycopg2-binary>=2.9

# Additional dependencies can be added here as your project grows.
# Gunicorn is a production-ready WSGI server for Flask
gunicorn>=20.1
